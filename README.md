# Tabl

Tabl was created by the four of us in fall of 2018 for a semester long class to teach us about long term project work and integration with source control software.

## How to use?

Download the zip file. First setup the mysql database with the schema file. Then use a php editor like xamp, copy the php files in web to the htdocs folder and run localhost to launch main login.
For the java app, you need to open the project in a java editor like eclipse with mysql database setup from schema. The jdbc settings willneed to change to your localhost, likely localhost:8080. From there the program should allow full operation.
