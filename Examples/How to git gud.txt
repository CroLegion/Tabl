General Git Procedure

Any time you want to write or edit code, just switch to your branch using:
$ git checkout <your-branch>

<Do stuff here>

After making your changes on the files, run commit on all files:
$ git commit -a -m "MY MESSAGE HERE"

Then switch back to master with:
$ git checkout master

Then do:
$ git merge <your-branch>

And then push:
$ git push

That should be all you need to do from start of editing to being done editing, any merge problems that surface should give you the change to fix them in the terminal.
